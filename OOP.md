# What is OOP?
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

## What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
- Encapsulation.
- Inheritance.
- Abstraction.
- Polymorphism.

### What are the benefits of OOP?
- Productivity - The productivity of two codes increases through the use of Object-Oriented Programming. This is because the OOP has provided so many libraries that new programs have become more accessible.
- Solving problems - Problems can be efficiently solved by breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and this makes as one of the big advantages of object-oriented programming.
- Code Flexibility - The flexibility is offered through the concept of Polymorphism. A scenario can be considered for a better understanding of the concept. A person can behave differently whenever the surroundings change.
- Troubleshooting is easier with the OOP language - Helps the user look into the code to fix the errors within the code.

#### What are the functionality of each pillar?
- Encapsulation -  Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit i.e. class.
- Inheritance - The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the property of another object. 
- Abstraction - Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information.
- Polymorphism - A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class. A subclass can have their own behavior and share some of its behavior from its parent class not the other way around. A parent class cannot have the behavior of its subclass.
